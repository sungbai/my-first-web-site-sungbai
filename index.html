      <p><li>A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is
         identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.
         Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.</li>

         All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
      There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network,
      such as a company's internal website for its employees.

          Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose,
      such as news, education, commerce, entertainment,  or social networking.
      Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site,
      which often starts with a home page.</p>
